# ContaSoft

**ContaSoft** is a web-based accounting system designed to simulate the complete accounting process in an educational environment. The application allows users to manage fictional companies, accounting cycles, and perform essential accounting operations such as creating entries, viewing ledgers, and generating financial statements. When entries are added to the journal, other components such as the general ledger, trial balance, and financial statements are automatically updated to reflect the new data.

The application features an intuitive interface for managing accounting data and practicing accounting processes in a controlled environment. It is developed in Java using the Javalin framework and Freemarker for the templating engine, with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for the frontend, ensuring a smooth and modern user experience.
